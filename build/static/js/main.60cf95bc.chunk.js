Am I already on the way out? When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage I'm a dog in a dog pound And you said I was your secret And you didn't get to keep it And the internet is hungry for the meanest kinda funny And somebody's gotta feed it Oh, do you still cry? Still cry Cry I never did you wrong (Never did you wrong) And my Oh, my patience is gone (Is gone) And I I never did you wrong (You) I, I loved you for so long (Hmm)"},{name:"Peter",cover:"https://github.com/q113pt/MusicLibrary/blob/main/Cover/the%20ttpd%20(%20Peter%20).png?raw=true",artist:"Taylor Swift",audio:"https://github.com/q113pt/MusicLibrary/blob/main/Taylor%20Swift%20-%20Peter.mp3?raw=true",color:["#ffaddd","#ff007b"],id:Object(I.a)(),active:!1,lyrics:"Forgive me Peter My lost fearless leader In closets like cedar Preserved from when we were just kids Is it something I did The goddess of timing Once found us beguiling She said she was trying Peter was she lying My ribs get the feeling she did And I didn't want to come down I thought it was just goodbye for now You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Words from the mouths of babes promises, oceans deep But never to keep Oh, never to keep Are you still a mind reader? A natural scene stealer I've heard great things Peter But life was always easier on you Than it was on me And sometimes it gets me When crossing your jet stream We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon In different galaxies And I didn't want to hang around We said it was just goodbye for now You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Words from the mouths of babes promises, oceans deep But never to keep Oh, never to keep And I won't confess that I waited But I let the lamp burn As the men masqueraded I hoped you'd return With your feet on the ground Tell me all that you'd learned Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned And you said you'd come and get me but you were 25 And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired Lost to the lost boys chapter of your life Forgive me Peter, please know that I tried To hold onto the days when you were mine But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me You said you were gonna grow up You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Said you were gonna grow up You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me You said you were gonna grow up Then you were gonna come find me Words from the mouths of babes promises, oceans deep But never to keep"}]};var p=function(){const[e,t]=Object(a.useState)(f()),[o,n]=Object(a.useState)(e[0]),[i,s]=Object(a.useState)(!1),[u,h]=Object(a.useState)(!1),[c,m]=Object(a.useState)(!1),[g,I]=Object(a.useState)([]),[p,v]=Object(a.useState)([]),[k,j]=Object(a.useState)({currentTime:0,duration:0,animationPercentage:0}),[O,S]=Object(a.useState)(!1),x=Object(a.useRef)(null),B=e=>{const t=e.target.currentTime,o=e.target.duration,a=Math.round(t),n=Math.round(o),i=Math.round(a/n*100);j({...k,currentTime:t,duration:o,animationPercentage:i})},T=o=>{const a=e.map((e=>e.id===o.id?{...e,active:!0}:{...e,active:!1}));t(a)};return Object(r.jsxs)("div",{className:"App \n                        ".concat(u?"library_active":""," \n                        ").concat(O?"dark":"","\n                        ").concat(c?"list_active":""),children:[Object(r.jsx)(b,{libraryStatus:u,setLibraryStatus:h,listStatus:c,setListStatus:m,darkTheme:O,setDarkTheme:S,darkThemeHandler:()=>{S(!1===O)}}),Object(r.jsx)(l,{currentSong:o,songInfo:k}),Object(r.jsx)(d,{isPlaying:i,setIsPlaying:s,currentSong:o,audioRef:x,songInfo:k,setSongInfo:j,songs:e,setCurrentSong:n,setSongs:t}),Object(r.jsx)(y,{libraryStatus:u,isPlaying:i,setCurrentSong:n,audioRef:x,songs:e,setSongs:t,listQueue:g,setListQueue:I,typeOfButton:"faPlus"}),Object(r.jsx)(w,{listStatus:c,isPlaying:i,currentSong:o,setCurrentSong:n,audioRef:x,songs:e,setSongs:t,listQueue:g,setListQueue:I,listRecommend:p,setListRecommend:v,typeOfButton:"faPlus"}),Object(r.jsx)("audio",{onTimeUpdate:B,onLoadedMetadata:B,ref:x,src:o.audio,onEnded:async()=>{if(0!==g.length){let e=g.findIndex((e=>e.id===o.id));await n(g[(e+1)%g.length]),T(g[(e+1)%g.length])}else{let t=e.findIndex((e=>e.id===o.id));await n(e[(t+1)%e.length]),T(e[(t+1)%e.length])}i&&x.current.play()}})]})};s.a.render(Object(r.jsx)(n.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(r.jsx)(p,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[15,1,2]]]);
